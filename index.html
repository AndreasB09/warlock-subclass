          <h2>Origins of the pact</h2>
          <p id="flavor-text">A curse from one cursed</p>
          <p>
            About a mile outside of Heron's Crossing, within the forest, lies a glade. Sometimes serene, sometimes unsettling. It is said the feeling it gives depends entirely on who enters. The glade itself is quiet and strangely beautiful. The undergrowth never seems overgrown. Fallen branches are few, and the grass grows in gentle waves, soft beneath the feet. There is a sense that, until recently, someone tended to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its heart stands a great hazel tree. Ancient in appearance, it looks as old as time itself, but if the locals are to be believed, it hasn't been there all that long. Its bark is covered with deep, spiraling grooves. Moss clings to its roots, which twist into the ground like searching fingers. Near its base, four letters are carved, worn by the weather but still clear: <strong>A</strong> and <strong>F</strong>, <strong>K</strong> and <strong>S</strong>. No one knows who carved them, or when.. but the tree remembers. And if you press your hand to those letters, the bark is warm, faintly pulsating like a heartbeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            They say a massacre once took place there. A traveling group of performers was found by the villagers of Heron's Crossing, all dead. Some claim it was plague. Others speak of madness, or cult-like delusions. The stories never agree, except in one detail: the runes, scrawled in blood throughout the camp. No signs of the bodies remain now. Only the tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            The air around it is thick, like breathing in old magic. Time slows in its shade. Whispers drift through the tall grass, curling around ankles like unseen hands. Some claim the tree has spoken to them. Others say it watches. And lately, more and more, the witches from the outskirts have been seen in the glade, lingering longer each time, listening.

            The magic of Hazel seeps into your mind like roots into soil. You always have certain spells ready. When you reach a warlock level listed in the <a href="#spells-table" id="table-link">Wilderness Spells</a> table, you gain the corresponding spell, and it counts as a warlock spell for you. These spells donâ€™t count against the number of spells you know.

        <h2>Level 3: Duskwithered Boon</h2>
        <p>
          When you make a pact with Hazel's tree, she grants you a cursed boon. Choose one of the following:<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ability-title">Hag's Grasp.</span> Your melee spell attacks have an extra 10 ft. range as spectral, gnarled branches lash out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ability-title">Black Sap Vitality.</span> When you hit a creature with Eldritch Blast, you can regain HP equal to your Charisma modifier once per turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="ability-title">Crone's Wisdom.</span> You can cast <a href="#" class="spell-link" data-spell="detect-magic">Detect Magic</a> and <a href="#" class="spell-link" data-spell="detect-poison-and-disease">Detect Poison and Disease</a> at will, without expending a spell slot. You also gain proficiency in the Herbalism Kit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you learn the <a href="#" class="spell-link" data-spell="entangle">Entangle</a> spell. It counts as a warlock spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells known.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="level6">
        <h2>Level 6: Twisting Roots</h2>
        <p>
          Hazel's reach grows with you. When you deal damage to a creature with a spell, you can summon spectral roots from the earth beneath them. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become <a href="#" class="rule-link" data-rule="restrained">Restrained</a> until the start of your next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per <a href="#" class="rule-link" data-rule="long-rest">Long Rest</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="level10">
        <h2>Level 10: Withered Curse</h2>
        <p>
          As a bonus action, you can mark a creature within 30 feet with Hazel's spite. For one minute, the creature is cursed. A cursed creature has <a href="#" class="rule-link" data-rule="disadvantage">Disadvantage</a> on Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The next time the cursed creature is reduced to 0 HP, spectral roots burst from their body. The ground within 10 ft. becomes difficult terrain for one minute, as twisted vines and bark spread from the corpse. You can use this feature once per <a href="#" class="rule-link" data-rule="long-rest">Long Rest</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="level14">
        <h2>Level 14: Hazel's Embrace</h2>
        <p>
          You can call upon Hazel's true form, temporarily becoming a terrible hag-like entity. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain:
        </p>
        <p>Resistance to non-magical weapon damage</p>
        <p>You can move through difficult terrain caused by plants without penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a creature within 10 ft. of you hits you with a melee attack, they take necrotic damage equal to your Warlock level as your cursed sap lashes out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a <a href="#" class="rule-link" data-rule="long-rest">Long Rest</a>.
